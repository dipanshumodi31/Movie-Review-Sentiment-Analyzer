## üìù Overview  
This project demonstrates a **sentiment analysis pipeline** for IMDB movie reviews using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)**.  

It covers the full workflow:  
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Feature engineering (BoW & TF-IDF)  
- Model building and evaluation  
- Error analysis for misclassifications  
- Deployment demo for real-world predictions  

---

## üéØ Objectives  
- Develop a **robust sentiment classifier** for movie reviews.  
- Compare multiple ML models using BoW and TF-IDF features.  
- Evaluate models using statistical metrics and visualization techniques.  
- Showcase results in a **professional, industry-ready format**.  
- Build a **deployment prototype** for real-world application.

## ‚öô Workflow  

![Pipeline](./assets/pipeline.png)  
*Figure: Sentiment Analysis Pipeline ‚Äì End-to-end process from dataset to deployment demo.* 

### *1. Data Loading*  
- Dataset: **IMDB Movie Reviews** (~5,000 reviews sample from 50,000 total).  
- Balanced across *Positive* and *Negative* sentiment classes.  

### *2. Data Preprocessing*  
- Lowercasing, punctuation removal, tokenization.  
- Stopword removal using NLTK.  
- Snowball stemming to unify word forms.  
- Construction of **n-grams** (bi-grams, tri-grams) to capture context.  

### *3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)*  
- **Class Distribution:**  
  The dataset is **balanced**, containing nearly equal numbers of positive and negative reviews (~2,500 each).  
  ![Class Distribution](./assets/class_distribution.png)  

- **Review Length Analysis:**  
  Boxplots show that both positive and negative reviews have similar length distributions, mostly ranging between **100‚Äì250 words**, with some outliers going beyond 800 words.  
  ![Review Length](./assets/boxplot_review_length.png)  
- Word frequency distributions.  
- **WordClouds** for Positive vs Negative reviews.  
- Review length analysis (short vs long reviews).  

### *4. Feature Engineering*  
- **Bag-of-Words (BoW):** Simple frequency counts.  
- **TF-IDF:** Weighted representation for better feature discrimination.  
- Comparative study of BoW vs TF-IDF.  

### *5. Model Training & Evaluation*  
Implemented Algorithms:  
- Logistic Regression ‚úÖ  
- Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB) ‚úÖ  
- Support Vector Machine (SVC) ‚úÖ  
- Random Forest ‚úÖ  

**Evaluation Metrics:**  
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score  
- Confusion Matrix  
- ROC Curve & AUC  

### *6. Error Analysis*  
- Misclassified reviews often contained sarcasm, negations, or mixed opinions.  
- Example: *‚ÄúThe movie was so good that I fell asleep halfway through‚Äù* ‚Üí misclassified.  

### *7. Deployment Demo*  
- Prototype interface where users input reviews.  
- Outputs: **Predicted Sentiment (Positive/Negative)** + **Confidence Score**.  
- Example:  
  - *‚ÄúAvengers Endgame was absolutely phenomenal‚Ä¶‚Äù* ‚Üí Positive (**0.70**)  
  - *‚ÄúThe movie was painfully slow‚Ä¶‚Äù* ‚Üí Negative (**0.79**)  
- Integrated **LIME explanations** for interpretability.

## üèÜ Results  

**Final Model Performance (on 5,000 review subset):**  

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |  
|----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|----------|  
| Naive Bayes (BoW)    | 0.825    | 0.816     | 0.834  | 0.825    |  
| Naive Bayes (TF-IDF) | 0.825    | 0.816     | 0.834  | 0.825    |  
| Logistic Regression  | **0.859** | 0.832     | **0.895** | **0.862** |  
| SVM                  | 0.852    | 0.825     | 0.889  | 0.856    |  
| Random Forest        | 0.829    | **0.837** | 0.812  | 0.824    |  

**Key Finding:** Logistic Regression with TF-IDF features achieved the **best performance**.
